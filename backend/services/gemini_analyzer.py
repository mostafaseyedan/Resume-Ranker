As an expert technical recruiter with 20+ years of experience, analyze this candidate's resume against the job requirements.

RESUME TEXT:
{resume_text}

JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}
{skill_weights_text}

SCORING METHODOLOGY:
You must calculate the overall_score (0-100) using this weighted formula:

1. Skills Match (40% of total score):
   - For each skill in skill_analysis, assign a score (0-10) based on candidate's proficiency
   - Use the skill's weight from SKILL IMPORTANCE WEIGHTS (higher weight = more important)
   - Calculate weighted average: sum(skill_score * skill_weight) / sum(skill_weights)
   - Convert to percentage: (weighted_average / 10) * 100
   - Multiply by 0.40 for final skills component

2. Experience Match (30% of total score):
   - Evaluate total_years: Does candidate meet minimum requirements? (0-10)
   - Evaluate relevant_years: How much experience is directly relevant? (0-10)
   - Evaluate role_progression: Clear career growth and increasing responsibility? (0-10)
   - Evaluate industry_match: Experience in same/similar industry? (0-10)
   - Average these four scores, convert to percentage, multiply by 0.30

3. Education Match (20% of total score):
   - Evaluate degree_relevance: How relevant is education to the role? (0-10)
   - Evaluate certifications: Does candidate have required/preferred certifications? (0-10)
   - Evaluate continuous_learning: Evidence of ongoing professional development? (0-10)
   - Average these three scores, convert to percentage, multiply by 0.20

4. Soft Skills Match (10% of total score):
   - Evaluate communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving based on resume evidence (0-10)
   - Convert to percentage, multiply by 0.10

OVERALL_SCORE = (Skills Component) + (Experience Component) + (Education Component) + (Soft Skills Component)

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:

For skill_analysis:
- Include all skills mentioned in SKILL IMPORTANCE WEIGHTS
- For each skill, provide:
  - skill: The skill name (must match job requirements)
  - required_level: Level needed for the job (e.g., "Expert", "Advanced", "Intermediate")
  - candidate_level: Candidate's actual level based on resume evidence
  - evidence: Specific examples from resume showing this skill
  - score: 0-10 rating of candidate's proficiency
  - weight: The importance weight from SKILL IMPORTANCE WEIGHTS (0-10)

For experience_match:
- total_years: Total years of professional experience (numeric)
- relevant_years: Years of directly relevant experience (numeric)
- role_progression: Description of career progression with assessment
- industry_match: Description of industry alignment with assessment

For education_match:
- degree_relevance: Explanation of how education relates to role
- certifications: List of all certifications found in resume
- continuous_learning: Evidence of recent training, courses, self-study

For strengths:
- Identify 3-5 top strengths with specific evidence from resume
- Focus on strengths most relevant to job requirements

For weaknesses:
- Identify 3-5 gaps or areas for improvement
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations for each
- Assess importance (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and impact on job performance

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Be objective but fair in your assessment
- If a resume demonstrates ALL required skills and experience, it should score 90%+
- If a resume has minor gaps but strong overall alignment, score should be 80-89%
- If a resume is comprehensively tailored with all requirements met and excellent presentation, score should be 95%+
- Give credit for skills demonstrated through project descriptions and accomplishments, not just listed skills
- Consider the overall package - strong alignment across multiple areas should result in high scores
